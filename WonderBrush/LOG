19.12.2006
	- added De-Noise filter based on CImg.h by David Tschumperl√©
	  (also known as GREYCstoration in other packages), the license is
	  similar to LGPL and I was allowed to use the header as long as
	  I mention where I got from.

21.11.2006
	- fixed the rest of the drag states of a transformation for use
	  with perspective transformations
	- fixed usage of clipping at the rasterizer level, can sometimes
	  result in huge performance improvements, and avoids program
	  appearing to freeze in some worst cases due to long unnecessary
	  calculations

15.11.2006
	- fixed the behaviour of the splitters between the list views
	- dragging and dropping layers or objects in such a way that no
	  change takes place, there is no unnecessary undo step inserted
	  anymore

13.11.2006
	- fixed WonderBrush's external editor feature, now bitmaps
	  will load in WonderBrush again when for example eXposer
	  uses WonderBrush as an external editor. Native images can
	  be edited in this way as well now

02.11.2006
	- implemented new bitmap interpolation "Resample", which gives
	  best results for downscaled bitmaps

28.06.2006
	- implemented new drag state for dragging the corner of a transform
	  box that works after perspective transformations
	- finally fixed the bug of the Transformation tool which caused the
	  undo steps to be messed up
	- fixed the bug that the confirmation icons stayed enabled in the
	  Transformation tool after the mouse was relased without changing
	  the transformation

26.06.2006
	- updated underlaying transformation code to support perspective
	  transformation, the transformation box already supports dragging
	  the corners freely, but more changes are necessary to make "normal"
	  affine transformations work after distorting the box

13.06.2006
	- fixed memory leak when removing points of a Shape's path

12.06.2006
	- dramatic speed increase of DropShadow and Gaussian Blur filters,
	  the filter time is almost independent of the filter radius, on
	  average, both filters work 10 times faster than before

08.04.2006
	- added MIME sniffer rule to make the system identify WonderBrush
		images more easily

04.04.2006
	- added Color Reduction filter, currently it converts to the
		system palette
	- RDef exporter optionally saves as an icon resource if the canvas
		happens to be 16x16 or 32x32

03.02.2006
	- "fixed" IconOptionsControl to not trigger re-layouting the window
		which seems to reduce start up time
	- vector paths are drawn with gaps to make them look better on Haiku

21.11.2005
	- now uses the previously edited path when entering Shape edit mode
	- fixed GradientControl startup size being too small to hold valid
		gradient bitmap

15.11.2005
	- fixed a small problem in the sliders in the Brush config: There was
		a gap of one pixel height in which clicking onto the slider moved
		neither the min nor the max thumb

12.11.2005
	- the path property was not updated when changing the round corner
		radius

10.11.2005
	- small bug fix in the SVG polyline parsing

31.10.2005
	- fixed some more GUI layout problems on ZETA (popup menus, File panel)
	- serial number is now displayed in about panel instead of
		"<running in demo mode>"
	- holding down <shift> while launching WonderBrush will cause the
		app to rewrite the document MIME type
	- on ZETA, an SVG icon is added to the document MIME type

28.10.2005
	- fixed bug with dragging stuff onto a list view with a tablet,
		the drop position would be messed up, dragging colors would
		mostly not work at all
	- now correctly restores tilt information in Brush objects from
		saved WonderBrush files
	- fixed a bug where the Brush cursor jumped to an offset under
		ZETA when clicked in zoomed documents
	- fixed two bugs in the Edit Gradient tool:
		- if Properties were pasted to Objects, it was very likely
			that editing Gradients had no effect anymore
		- changing a Gradients transformation did not update the
			Gradient Property correctly
	- added Tilt setting to Brush objects properties
	- fixed interpolation of alpha when double clicking to create a
		new Gradient stop
	- fixed broken interpolation of Gradients stops with alpha

20.10.2005
	- fixed two bugs in the Shape tool:
		- if you select another sub-path
			and accidentally click onto a point of the path, the click
			could start modifying the path
		- if you pressed or released a modifier key while already dragging
			with the mouse, unexpected results could happen

18.10.2005
	- replaced canvas list view with dragsortable version
	- added cool (negotiated) drag & drop from canvas list view to Tracker

17.10.2005
	- replaced potentially indefinitely large tab view with a regular
		list view to hold the list of open documents
	- fixed irritating open panel behaviour (always used path to last
		saved or exported file, now it does that only the first time
		it is opened)

14.10.2005
	- now supports the fill-rule property when importing SVG
	- gradients are blended in linear RGB space

13.10.2005
	- Pick Objects pick mask icons are now black & white

09.10.2005
	- Shape outlines created with subpixels off are shifted into the
		center of pixels depending on the outline width

	- SVG export supports gradients in all supported object types
	- font manager uses a more reliable family name

07.10.2005
	- drastical speed up of switching from layers with many objects
	- SVG export saves relative coords to save some space
	- documents are forced to R5 format on ZETA

	- added Text Alignment to the configuration GUI of the Text tool
		(was Property only before)
	- fixed some potential "low memory" crashing bugs

03.10.2005
	- added SVG icon to ZETA version

01.10.2005
	- added Round Rect Radius to (Round) Rect tool so that it finally
		deserves the (Round)

30.09.2005
	- fixed a bug constrain rect missunderstanding bug in the text
		renderer
	- small optimization in the path rendering

29.09.2005
	- fixed scrolling of regions outside of canvas
	- updated Canvas context menu
	- should have fixed remaining tearing problems, there can still
		be some tearing observed at certain zoom levels, but I'm sure
		they are caused by inaccurate code in the app_server scaled
		bitmap drawing routine (the seems to be an optimization for
		150% scaling which has problems, the generic scaling at 151% or
		149% is fine)

28.09.2005
	- started looking into scrolling/zooming related "canvas tearing
		problems" (fixed some, but there seem to be some more)

26.09.2005
	- do not show "Cap" and "Join Mode" properties on non-outline Shape
		objects
	- fixed some more "update color" bugs
		- when the Edit Gradient control becomes focus, color is
			updated to the active color stop
		- the color field marker did not update in certain situations

22.09.2005
	- prevent giving objects a zero scale in one or both directions, this
		prevents an obscure app_server crash from happening, besides, who
		would want zero scale objects anyways...
	- bug fix for changing properties of Shape objects after control
		points have been nudged, now path will stay the same
	- improved word and glyph spacing for justify aligned Text objects
	- optimized SVG export for file size a bit more
		(use more path commands, limit to two digits after decimal point
		for coordinates)
	- the SVG export is now smart enough to warn the user when atempting
		to overwrite an SVG file, that originally had tags ignored by the
		SVG import
	- uses "Copy" cursor in Pick Object tool when <Shift> is pressed
	- reworked cut/copy/paste behaviour, the shortcuts work in Object list,
		and also finally in the Text tools text input
	- made negotiated drag&drop (other app->WonderBrush) work correctly
		(tested with ShowImage)

21.09.2005
	- fixed ugly scrollviews under ZETA, also fixes Drag&Drop flickering
		because of focus color animation
	- fixed Brush cursor sticking arround when mouse leaves CanvasView
		under ZETA
	- fixed problems with hit testing and integer pixel mouse tracking
	- nudging in Shape tool no longer ignores/bypasses an on-going
		transformation, nudging is now handled by the transformbox directly
	- deleting control points in the Shape tool finishes an on-going
		transformation first
	- hue is now updated correctly when the color has no saturation
	- efficiency improvements to color slider and color field

17.09.2005
	- Bitmap objects have an Opacity property now

16.09.2005
	- improved SVG import
		- removal of duplicate path control points
		- implemented A/a command for arcs
	- much more accurate aproximation of circles and ellipses

14.09.2005
	- SVG exports "Line To" insted of "Cubic Curve" command when appropriate
	- SVG export tries to avoid exporting a transformation matrix if the transformation
		can be "frozen"
	- if the first Shape used for a Merge Shape command has a gradient, the
		transformation is applied to the gradient before it is frozen

12.09.2005
	- updated Shape tool to also remember Shape settings of the last edited
		Shape which only have a Property but no control in the config GUI
	- fixed problems with object inherited transformation when displaying
		the transformation box of a gradient (mouse cursors could have
		wrong rotation)

11.09.2005
	- fixed problems with changing object properties during an ongoing
		transformation, the transform box will always be the right size,
		additionally the transformation will be performed first
	- fixed dirty pixels bug in Shape tool when it was canceled
	- "text width" is now displayed with a handle that can be controlled
		with the mouse in Text tool
	- more logical Text properties order
	- speed improvement for clipped text rendering
	- Text tool remembers all Text properties of the last edited Text
		object for creating a new Text object
	- added first line of paragraph indention (mouse draggable) and
		paragraph line spacing scale
	- additional text settings, which have no controls in the Text tool,
		are now also persistent (taken from the last edited Text object)

10.09.2005
	- complete rework of text and glyph layout algorithm, should add
		a little speed up even and supports left, center, right and
		justify alignment in a certain width
	- fixes for hinted text, the additional glyph spacing becomes
		truncated to integer units and a translation is rounded, except
		if the transformation on the text object contains rotation and
		scale as well

09.09.2005
	- Guides can now be moved with the cursor keys, hitting <Delete>
		will delete the current guide
	- fixed "rotate cursor appears *inside* transformation box" bug that
		I introduced some time ago
	- big cleanup in text rendering (single glyph layouting function)

06.09.2005
	- implemented first draft of Serial Number panel
	- using <Tab> or <Enter> on text controls no longer loses the
		selection of the focused text control, so that a new value
		can be typed without having to first select/delete the previous
		text (Transformation controls, Property controls, etc)

03.09.2005
	- AI Exporter knows about sub paths
	- fixed SVG Export to use the "closed" property of each sub path

01.09.2005
	- fixed crashing bug that happened sometimes on exit (Ingo)

31.08.2005
	- added "Merge Shapes" function to Object->Special menu, available when
		at least two Shape objects are selected. The merged Shape will have
		all the paths from the original Shapes and the properties of the
		first original Shape.
	- added a way to freeze the transformations of Shape objects and
		VectorPaths (used by above feature)

30.08.2005
	- some work and fixes on Bitmap objects, added Interpolation
		property -> Nearest Neighbor and Bilinear are supported

	- fixed bug in Shape tool, when removing points with the Delete key, the
		Path property was not updated
	- localization of Guides tool
	- replaced buttons in Guides tool with icons
	- added "Da Vinci" icon to Guides tool, which places a selected Guide
		onto the closest "Golden Proportion"

22.08.2005
	- when using the TAB key in the dimension control to jump from one to
		the next text control, (ie Width -> Height), the selection will
		no longer get lost because the text changes when the proportion
		lock is on
	- added cool "Duplicate" (with transformation) function to Object menu
	- added "All" and "None" buttons to Pick Objects tool, to quickly
		change the pick mask accordingly
	- added "All" and "None" buttons to Pick Objects tool, to quickly
		select all or no objects
	- B_SELECT_ALL is now a more global shortcut to select all objects,
		in the Shape tool, it selects all path control points when
		a path is being edited

19.08.2005
	- fixed export of transformed linear gradients

18.08.2005
	- added "pick" mask to Pick Objects tool

		rect with one pixel width/height
	- more work on direct selection tool, selection of all objects
		in an area
	- fixed selection of objects that don't use an alpha map (Bitmap)

		was active
	- started work on "Pick Objects" tool (picking objects directly on
		canvas)
	- renamed new "Color" filter to "Area"

13.08.2005
	- mouse mode is now updated in Shape tool when switching to another
		sub path

10.08.2005
	- added new "Color" Filter, that is simply spanning the entire layer
		and fills it with the given rendering mode
	- added drag & drop of colors onto layers list, which uses the new
		"Color" filter

08.08.2005
	- finished work on drag & drop of objects onto and between layers
		to move/copy (shift held down) them onto existing or new layers
	- improved usability by indicating "copy" action in cursor during
		drag & drop in layers/object list
	- show less properties on Brush based objects, if dynamic control
		is turned off
	- select just the clicked point on MouseUp, if a set of more selected
		points was not moved in the Shape tool

07.08.2005
	- started work on drag & drop of objects from one layer to
		another
	- improved path cleanup

06.08.2005
	- when dragging one of many selected control points, the whole
		set will be dragged
	- double clicking between gradient stops in the gradient control
		creates a new stop with the interpolated color from that
		location
	- fixed a syntax bug when exporting transparent gradient stops in SVG
	- Gradient control can now show transparent stops
	- usability improvements to editing a gradient:
		- dropping a color to add a stop will make the control focused
		- editing the current color will edit the current stop as well
			if the gradient control has focus
		- clicking on a stop will set the canvas current color
		- all these changes make it much easier to edit stop colors
			(no excessive drag&drop anymore)
	- added slider to control the active gradient stop's opacity

05.08.2005
	- added "Text to Shape" conversion, it's under Object->Special, and
		you need to have Text objects selected
	- fixed "curve3" command "import", should have fixed SVG import too
	- removing all points of a path will remove the whole path from
		the Shape object
	- fixed crashing bug when pressing Delete key in Shape tool when
		no Shape object had been created yet
	- added icons to Shape tool: Transform Points (in exchange for
		the button), New (Sub) Path, Delete (selected points)
	- better GUI updates in Shape tool, "Closed" checkbox no longer
		enabled when path can not be closed (due to too few points)
	- fixed stickyness of New Path mode after switching to another tool
	- When importing from AGG path_storage, curve3 is now converted to
		curve4 for better editing (most visible in Text to Shape command)

04.08.2005
	- fixed a pretty obscure bug in the export modules when writing
		floating point numbers. It effected mostly transformations,
		especially radial gradients in SVG files. Basically, a number
		like "0.073" would have been written as "0.73"...
	- fixed a couple of bugs with properties in new sub-path stuff
	- fixed weird path point selection behaviour from last beta,
		plus older selection weirdness
	- fixed transformation of newly created subpaths if the parent
		object already was transformed
	- fixed crashing bug when canceling Shape tool and the last
		editing action had been adding a new sub path
	- you have to hold down B_OPTION_KEY to create a new sub path,
		the default mode for closed paths is now "Select Points" and
		"Add Point" for unclosed paths, as before. Selection works
		much better again that way.
	- when selecting another sub-path, all its points are automatically
		selected
	- added Filling Rule to Shape object properties
	- fixed a bad bufferoverrun bug in the SVG export. More than ten
		gradients caused a buffer overrun and bogus to be written,
		though irritatingly no crash.
	- fixed bug in Shape tool, it now syncs with the Shapes current
		path when a property was changed

03.08.2005
	- added units (%, px for now) to Guide tool
	- Shape tool shifts control points by 0.5x0.5 pixels (to the
		pixel center), when in Outline and non-Subpixel mode
	- started work on creating and editing sub paths, missing is
		the adding of each subpath as a stand alone Property, so
		they can be copied individually

02.08.2005
	- Guides tool now more or less working - missing: Undo stack,
		rotation of guides along with canvas, units option
	- fixed crashing bug in Shape tool introduced in 1.7.1, when
		pressing the delete key with no points selected

01.08.2005
	- "implemented" SVG path commands T/t
	- some text controls could still have keyboard focus
		when switching to another tool, which broke some
		of the keyboard control functionality

31.07.2005
	- restructured ShapeStroke::Draw(), uses special Bresenham
		rasterizer for solid strokes with width = 1, also doesn't
		set even-odd fill mode any more, which also fixes a back
		wards compatibility issue
	- started work on Guide tool

30.07.2005
	- can no longer do anything in the canvas view when no layer
		is set (thanks Marcin)

30.07.2005 (1.7.1)
	- fixed printing (tested with Preview and PDF printer on ZETA)
	- added "All" buttons to Crop and Select tool which set the
		rectangle to the entire canvas

	- added "inherit transformation" option to Gradients
	- added auto scrolling to Select, Crop, Transform, Edit Gradient,
		Text and Shape tool (there you go Christian)
	- fixed a crashing bug in the Edit Gradient tool, which happened
		when a gradient object was selected when switching to another
		tool from the Edit Gradient tool and then undoing something
		which affected the selected object (thanks Mikael)

28.07.2005
	- fixed memory leak in VectorPath::operator=()
	- WarpSharp filter no longer tries to sharp homogenous areas,
		which appeared to take forever (thanks Axel)
	- fixed crashing bug in PopupSlider control (eg Zoom slider)
		when clicking it more than once while the window thread
		was busy (thanks Axel)
	- fixed bug in PopupSlider control which caused the slider
		to stick to the mouse cursor even if the mouse was
		already released (thanks Axel)
	- implemented cleaning up of paths, this means that
		WonderBrush Image -> SVG -> WonderBrush Image will restore
		pretty much the same Shape objects with no extra points
		and no broken in-out control points connections
	- fixed a bug in Shape tool when removing path points so
		that only one or no points remained, if the path was
		closed before, it is unclosed, so that new points can be
		added again
	- tracked down a pretty obscure bug in the AGG path storage
		code, which caused some SVGs to load incorrectly (thanks Paco)

27.07.2005
	- hitting Return or Escape in Ellipse and Rect tools applies
		or cancels the tools as it should (thanks stargater)

26.07.2005
	- fixed last minute bug in pasting Path property to Shapes
		with mutliple subpaths

26.07.2005
	- switches to Pen Eraser from Pen if tablet pen is used with
		its eraser end

	- the Gradient control has a disabled look
	- added "Trash" icons to Layer and Object list views to delete
		the selected layer or objects
	- all sub paths of a Shape object are put into the "Path"
		Property and are correctly copied/pasted

25.07.2005
	- objects in gradient mode now have an icon with their gradient
		in the Object list
	- speed optimizations for the Brush rendering
	- fixed bug: Brush with 100% hardness were not rendered without
		anti-aliasing if "Solid" was checked (post 1.6.1 bug)
	- fixed precision issues with gradient rendering
		(colors were slightly transparent, mostly visible with dark
		colors)
	- fixed precision issues with Fill tool rendering (same as above)
	- fixed a bug with setting the color of an object by dropping
		a color onto the color property (post 1.6.1 bug)
	- fixed bug with transform box for ellipse and rect tool
		(almost always in "translate" mode)
	- the proportion lock is also affecting the scale controls in
		the Resize panel
	- the state of the proportion locks (at least in New and Resize panel)
		is remembered now
	- fixed some off by one bugs in Gradient::MakeGradient()

22.07.2005
	- fixed drop shadow bug (random shadow pixels at bottom of canvas)

21.07.2005
	- added basic tilt support to Brush drawing, but it needs to be
		part of Brush flags yet with it being turned off by default

20.07.2005
	- VectorPath::Iterator uses incremantal curve approximation just
		for path display (alternating black/white lines)

18.07.2005
	- updated to AGG 2.3

17.07.2005
	- when an Object is set to Gradient mode, and a new Gradient is
		created, the gradient is fit to the Object's bounds.

		gradient types, fixed more bugs, added tool tips, shortcut etc.
	- fixed bug that the language was reset to English when editing
		a language file and WonderBrush recompiled it

		offset, viewBox is used instead of width and height, colors can
		be specified using only three letters (#bf6)

14.07.2005
	- added localization for Gradient stuff

13.07.2005
	- fixed more bugs in Edit Gradient Tool, including crashing bugs
	- the Gradient is now a Property which can be copied and pasted
		to other objects

10.07.2005

		are currently rendered with even-odd filling rule. However,
		they cannot be accessed through the GUI yet.
	- worked a lot on SVG loading support with gradients
	- updated SVG export to support subpaths and gradients

14.06.2005

	- worked over help strings for tools
	- fixed bug in color picker, it would switch to the last tool
		usable with color, instead of staying in color picker mode
	- implemented Opacity setting for Fill tool (there you go, Axel :-)

18.03.2005
	- Undo history of Ellipse tool is working, and lots of other
		Ellipse tool details

		like it (refactored reusable bits of Ellipse tool)
	- the Rect tool is missing a "round corners" option yet
	- drew new icons for the Ellipse and Rect tool
	- found a nice way to turn off anti-aliasing in Text and Shape
		objects (via Property list only)
	- fixed a bug in new Gradient stuff

		no longer appear when the cursor is not near a true path segment


03.03.2005
	- special cased brush drawing code for hardness=100% like in
		pre-AGG version, which gives a nice speed up
	- fixed crashing bug in Property list when brush was drawn outside canvas

06.02.2005

		when no Text object was being edited

14.01.2005
	- fixed flickering in Property list view when object properties change
		and/or another object is selected
	- fixed font sorting again, now it should work correctly for all cases
	- font popup menu now behaves like a normal BMenuField and tries to
		locate the currently marked item under the mouse
	- it is now possible to cycle through all installed fonts by the means of 
		<Command>+<Up>/<Down> while the Text tool is active

13.01.2005
	- fixed glitch in invalidation of splitter GUI object
	- using the Shape tool should be smoother now when working on new Shape
		objects

12.01.2005
	- implemented "Replace Red|Green|Blue" layer blending modes
	- fixed invalidation bug when switching layer blending modes involving
		"Alpha" and "Inverse Alpha"
	- found better algorithm for "Alpha" and "Inverse Alpha" blending modes
		(min_c(srcAlpha, dstAlpha) instead of srcAlpha*dstAlpha/255)
	- fixed "Inverse Multiply" blending mode to work as "Screen" in Photoshop
	- implemented "Lighten" and "Darken" blend modes more are to follow...
	- hopefully fixed an invalidation glitch in the popup slider (eg Zoom)
	- fixed irritating bug in Copy and Crop tool, which didn't "auto-cancel"
		when another tool was selected

30.12.2004
	- fixed memleaks in font renderer

08.12.2004
	- the keyfile can now be put into the WonderBrush settings folder
		while the app is running, unlocking will be live
	- WB now renders a demo text string on top of the canvas, also when

	- improvements in font handling, font menu sorting should work better
	- better export of correct font in SVG
	- Pen object export in SVG
	- Fill object export in SVG, not working yet

06.12.2004
	- the file extension is now automatically adjusted when changing
		the export module in the export panel and so on
	- Text object export in SVG
	- fixed some crashing bugs in FontManager, that were triggered by
		certain fonts

05.12.2004
	- finished bitmap support in exporting SVG

04.12.2004
	- implemented base64 encoder (needed for embedding bitmaps in SVG)

02.12.2004
	- implemented "IconOptionsControl", which handles switching pressed
		state of icons as mutually exclusive options, used for cap and join
		modes in Shape tool


29.11.2004
	- implemented different line cap and join modes in Shape tool
		-> TODO: Shape->GUI update, undo actions, better (space saving) controls

28.11.2004
	- first steps of an Ellipse tool, pretty rough and non-functional yet

26.-27.11.2004
	- Text and Bitmap object export in Illustrator files

24.11.2004
	- validated Adobe Illustrator export
	- implemented remembering the last file panel folder (hope it is as
		smart as I intended it to be...)

23.11.2004
	- implemented Abobe Illustrator export, based in part on work done
		by Marcin Konicki

21.11.2004
	- bug hunting in Export feature

20.11.2004
	- implemented basic SVG export
	- redesigned (cleaned up, unified) the "Export" feature

08.11.2004
	- a bit more keyboard control in Property list for Option properties
		(the one with the popup menu): by using the cursors keys, one can
		cycle through the available options

07.11.2004
	- tracked down that nasty Fill tool crashing bug, should potentially
		have fixed other (crashing) symptoms in the app concerning bitmaps

06.11.2004
	- implemented nudging of control points when editing a path
	- reimplemented Fill algorithm, in my limited test, the speed up was more
		than x2

04.11.2004
	- tab navigation in the Property list view works now

03.11.2004
	- fixed a couple of undo actions to not update the Object list view,
		if that is showing a different layer than the changed object(s)
		live(s) on
	- build using the new GCC 2.95.3 which gives about a 20% speed increase
		(tested with layer blending) using -O3 :-)
	- changed a couple of things in the shutdown sequence, hopefully fixes a
		rare crash in the Filepanel destructor when quitting WonderBrush
	- looked hard in Fill tool, made some more preventive checks, but
		couldn't find a possible crashing bug.
	- the navigator now doesn't scale the preview up, only down to fit
		the given area
	- maximum zoom is now 3200%
	- navigator doesn't show dotted frame when entire canvas is visible
	- layer icons are also never scaled up anymore

29.10.2004
	- Subpixel precision can now be turned off for the Shape tool 

26.10.2004
	- tweaked the approximation scale of the Shape objects in outline mode,
		gives much smoother results

	- fixed a critical bug in Text tool, the whole system froze up
		wnen the text started with spaces
	- fixed the CPU hogging problem in drawing a straight line with Brush tool

24.10.2004
	- fixed bug in transform box (picking pivot was broken when zoomed in/out)

23.10.2004
	- fixed a bug in Shape and Text tool which caused the config GUI to
		incorrectly reflect the Shape/Text object having been double clicked
		to be edited

22.10.2004
	- work around for app_server bug in Zeta, which apparently filters
		mouse moved messages, so that when these events are generated by
		a tablet, they would not contain all fields (pressure, tilt, etc)
	- improved brush spacing code, so that when scaling up Brush objects,
		they look perfectly smooth now (instead of the spacing becoming
		visible)
	- work around for Zeta app_server bug (the one concerning drawing
		segments of a circle)

18.10.2004
	- fixed crashing bug in multi Property paste when an object was not
		caused to change at all

16.10.2004
	- fixed crashing bug when compiling language add-ons under on Zeta

14.10.2004
	- canvas name is now updated in canvas list when saving under a new name
	- fixed rendering bug when switching mode from Normal to Erase in case
		the object has been created (ie was not edited after having been
		applied once before, but was new)

13.10.2004
	- made cute little Undo/Redo icons
	- the Separator GUI object uses it's parents view color, which should
		fix some remaining problems when adjusting GUI colors on Zeta
	- fixed a crashing bug in the Halftone filter (changing properties)

12.10.2004
	- ported Halftone filter from ArtPaint, changed the semantics somewhat
	- added ability to chose line distance in Text tool (property only)
	- Object listview is now much less restrictive when currently editing
		a Text or Shape object
	- fixed a bug in the Shape tool, which caused not all the current
		settings of the tool to be applied to a new object
	- added Dispersion and Noise filter
	- fixed yet another problem with the canvas not being up to date when
		adjusting some property
	- fixed problem with which text control contains the most recent
		value in the Resize panel when closing the panel
	- relayouted Transform tool controls for the input fields to be wider

11.10.2004
	- ported Brightness, Contrast, Saturation and Motion Blur filter from
		ArtPaint
		- especially the Motion Blur algorithm is much improved compared to
			ArtPaint, all filters should work much faster than their originals
		- porting is fun, since such little amount of code has to be written
			for a filter thanks to the Property stuff
	- Shape and Text tools automatically apply when the selection changes

08.10.2004
	- fixed a bug with dragsorting objects, in certain situations, the dragged
		objects could just disappear

07.10.2004
	- the last filter whoes properties were edited will define the settings
		of a new filter being created of the same type
	- fixed "color change loop" bug in Shape and Text tools
	- the tool help message can now contain '\n' so that it line breaks in
		the bubble help

06.10.2004
	- fixed bug, picking a color from the actual Color Picker panel was
		not undoable in Text and Shape tool
	- fixed new bug from yesterday, setting the rectangles numerically in
		Select and Crop tool was broken
	- fixed Drop Shadow property changes, displays color now

05.10.2004
	- bugfixes in color property
	- Text tool is multiline now! Yay!
	- redesigned "spacing" effects again (in Font tool), negative spacing
		isn't possible anymore, while the effect looks much more evenly
		distributed now
	- better mouse wheel support in list views (drop mark is shown at the
		correct item)
	- fixed "Blur tool doesn't blur edge pixels" bug
	- fixed "transform box shows wrong cursors when flipped" bug
	- fixed "transform box leaves dirty pixels when zoomed out far enough" bug
	- fixed input of invalid chars in text inputs for numerical values
	- fixed Select text input (Top coordinate was ued where Left coordinate
		should have been used)
	- fixed that when transforming control points, it was possible to paste
		the Path property, which could change the position of control points
		without the transform box updating, nothing Bad actually happens
		though, even if the control points being transformed have disappeared
	- fixed a redraw bug in Shape tool when pasting path property

03.10.2004
	- translations for property stuff
	- more properties editable in Brush based objects
	- updated the Shape tool with the same redesign as the Text tool
	- implemented color property
	- updated TODO list
	- fixed a couple bugs in Fill tool
	- fixed problems in Transform tool (way too much rerendering the canvas)
	- fixed that weird buffer swapping bug

		has been loaded
	- fixed bug where canvas was not correctly updated when layers were merged
	- fixed bug in Transform tool where it was actually "applying" inside
		"cancelling"
	- lots of strings translated
	- fixed bug in Transform tool where changing the transformation through
		the text controls was not undoable
	- reintroduced nudging in Transform tool (cursor keys move objects)
		if SHIFT is held down, nudge distance will be one visible pixel
		(a fraction of a canvas pixel if zoomed in), otherwise one canvas
		pixel

01.-02.10.2004
	- implemented more types of properties (bool, path, font, option)
	- redesigned internal workings of Text tool (needs to be done for
		Shape tool as well)
	- bug hunting

31.09.2004
	- finished work on basic property design, imeplemented everything that
		was needed to get first results, WonderBrush can now interchange
		properties between different object types, selected properties can
		be pasted from one object to a mixed selection of other objects
	- new observer<->observable structure for objects

30.09.2004
	- worked on Int- and FloatProperty
	- imeplemented NumericalTextInput stuff
	- worked alot on PropertyListView

28.09.2004
	- more implementation for basics of Properties

27.09.2004
	- started imeplementing basic Property structure

24.09.2004
	- fixed bug in CloneStroke::ExtendRebuildArea, the offset is now
		correctly transformed

23.09.2004
	- design and conceptual thoughts of a Property Editor

22.09.2004
	- added Gaussian Blur filter
	- fixed some recently introduced bugs in Shape tool

21.09.2004
	- perfected Fill and Bitmap tool
	- started to code config GUI for filters

20.09.2004
	- redesign of Filters, implemented FilterFactory, should be easy to
		add new Filters

19.9.2004
	- implemented a Drop Shadow and an Invert filter

18.9.2004
	- added more convenience menu items to Object menu: Select All,
		Select None, Invert Selection, Remove.
	- renamed menu items in Object menu, Remove -> Remove All,
		Freeze -> Freeze All so that there should be no confusion that
		they actually ignore the selection

17.09.2004
	- smoothness of Shape and Font objects is now also dependent on
		overall scale, so that no precision is lost when scaling such
		objects up

16.09.2004
	- bugfixes in new Text tool implementation
	- bugfixes in transformation stuff concerning Shape tool
	- new behaviour for closing a path, there is now a checkbox in the
		Shape tool GUI for closing the path. When a Shape is not in
		outline mode, clicking the first point automatically closes the
		path, however, not so when the path is an outline, this way one
		can drag the first point without unwantingly closing the path, but
		one can still close an outline using the new checkbox.
	- started to fix transformation box mouse picking problems


15.09.2004
	- finished the GUI connection to the Transform tool
	- reimplemented the stroke caching system for the new transformation stuff
	- fixed big memory leak in Crop action and updated it to use
		new transformation stuff
	- implemented "Resize..." in Canvas menu (Blur tool won't give perfect
		results though)
	- implemented "Rotate" in Canvas menu
	- bugfixes to new Text tool implementation

12-13.09.2004
	- implemented undo stack for Transform tool
	- GUI for Transform tool

11.09.2004
	- redesigned Fill too with AGG backend which supports transformations
	- implemented zlib compression in Bitmap and Fill objects as well as
		Layers when they are loaded/saved, size of native documents much
		reduced, though saving takes notably longer
	- lots of bug hunting in the new code
	- fixed bug in Pen tool, the flags (solid, alpha controlled by pen pressure)
		where never saved correctly
	- fixed bug in Shape tool "insert point", which didn't show up before real
		transformations

10.09.2004
	- refactored Font rendering, implemented AGG backend which supports
		transformations, huge speed improvement noticable

09.09.2004
	- fixed the bug in Bitmap object rendering, is almost perfect yet
		(missing is the filtering in RGB not R'G'B space)
	- completed all features of the Brush tool in AGG backend, got rid of
		the existing problems (dark spots bug in small brush strokes
		with hardness < 100%)!
	- the Clone and Blur brush based tools will need some design decision...

08.09.2004
	- fixed bug in transformation, moving pivot didn't generate undo event
	- much work on transformations, Shape objects work, Bitmap objects work,
		but have a rendering bug, Brush based objects work, but rendering
		has serious problems 

07.09.2004
	- work on transformations

01.09.2004
	- some bugfixes in regard to pasting from the clipboard if another
		object was edited at the same time.
	- added Transform button to Shape tool config GUI
	- scaling by dragging a corner of the transform box in Shape tool can
		now maintain the aspect ratio when shift is held down.

30.08.2004
	- completed undo of control point selection changes

29.08.2004
	- finnished transformation and selection of control points in Shape tool

28.08.2004
	- undo for each step of the transformation, needs finishing up though

26.08.2004
	- better control point selection handling in Shape tool

22.-25.08.2004
	- more work on affine transformations, currently visible in Shape tool
		control point selection, transformation of selected points

21.08.2004
	- image data is now removed at pixels with alpha = 0 when saving the
		canvas as image (Translator bitmap)
	- fixed bugs in the Text tool, triggered if no settings file was present yet
	- all icons are truely transparent now, so they look nice in Zeta when
		the panel background color is not grey 216

13.-16.08.2004
	- worked on affine transformations
	
10.08.2004
	- tool tip for Copy tool
	- error alert when trying to copy empty area
	- bug fix in Crop and Copy tool when no action was performed,
		the undo/redo menu items would be labeled with the wrong action

07.08.2004
	- finnished temporary undo stack for Copy tool

06.08.2004
	- quick implementation of a simple Copy tool (copies a selected area
		to the system clipboard)

05.08.2004
	- final string fixes
	- tool tips are no longer toggled after using the Brush panel

03.08.2004
	- fully reimplemented MSplitter, this fixes the cursor not changing back
		from the MSplitter cursor

02.08.2004
	- fixed a couple of bugs when there is no settings file present:
		- the color field is having its marker at "black"
		- the fullscreen toggle icon is displaying the monitor icon
	- the pressure control for alpha and radius are off by default now,
		this should make more sense for new users, especially since most
		of them will not have a tablet. (it will also not trigger that
		Zeta app_server bug right at start)
	- updated and cleaned up all strings to be translatable
	- fixed a bug where the Navigator view was not up to date with the canvas
		when editing Shape and Text objects
	- dropped images generate layers with the file name again

01.08.2004
	- redesigned loading of bitmaps and documents, refactured and simplified.
		Result is that WonderBrush's own documents can now be appended to an
		existing document (by dropping it from Tracker while holding down
		shift). The whole loading process now takes place in another thread,
		and this also fixes the redraw problems when WonderBrush was launched
		with loading a document.
	- tried to fix a crashing bug in the Bitmap object, I only have an idea
		what caused it, and I couldn't reproduce the crash with some initial
		tests. I hope it is gone now.
	- probably fixed another crashing bug in the FreeType renderer, that was
		triggered when loading a document from someone else that contained
		Text objects using fonts that are not installed on the machine trying
		to load the document. (This is still a problem though, just not
		crashing I hope...)
	- fixed a display bug when switching a layer to "alpha mask" mode

31.07.2004
	- Crop tool usability improvements

23.07.2004
	- added some additional checks to BitmapModifier::MergeWithBitmap()
	- when freezing modifiers, empty parts of the layer are now excluded
		from the generated bitmap

21.07.2004
	- finished implementation of some global settings

19.07.2004
	-renamed "History" list to "Object" list

18.07.2004
	- fixed crashing bugs in the Fill tool (hopefully all, but a
		rewrite of the actual fill algorithm is also planned)

14.07.2004
	- fixed a bug I introduced when fixing alpha mask mode for layer
		blending
	- fixed some problems in Text tool behaviour when rendering takes too
		long -> much smoother now

08.07.2004
	- when doubleclicking a Shape, the color is set to that of the Shape
	- fixed redraw problem for translated Shapes
	- when shapes are edited, launching the color picker no longer exits the
		Shape tool, instead it sets the color of the shape being edited

07.07.2004
	- fixed a redraw problem in the layer merging when the layer blending
		mode was set to "alpha" or "inverse alpha"
	- the list of objects is now frozen (ie no objects can be removed,
		sorted or added) when an object is being "edited"

06.07.2004
	- the bounding box that the Translate tool shows arround all selected
		modifiers is now updated correctly in all cases

05.07.2004
	- debugging Wacom driver, except for some certain (un)plugging issues
		with multiple tablets, the driver works fine

04.07.2004
	- reimplemented Wacom tablet driver for USB V3

24.06.2004
	- some bug fixes for Translate tool
	- Translate tool displays now a bounding box for all selected objects
	- Text tool redraw bug fixes

21.06.2004
	- bug hunting for Text tool undo stack
	- added some remaining stuff as undoable, but Text tool has still
		some stuff left
	- strange problem redrawing the Navigator view, it is showing the
		previous image instead of the current

16.06.2004
	- implemented temporary undo stack for Crop tool
	- same thing goes for Text tool
	

15.06.2004
	- Crop tool is now confirmable, but has no temporary undo stack yet
	- fixed some crop tool visual bugs
	- the Confirm/Cancel icons get orange background color now when
		they are enabled to make them stick out
	- changed Confirm/Cancel icons
	- IconButton supports transparent icons now, should also look much better
		on Zeta, when user changed default panel background
	- moved internal support for nudging in CanvasView into Translate tool,
		where is belongs
	- fixed Clone tool visual bugs
	- removed word "Tool" from tool tips for Tool icons...
	- Shape tool no longer adds Shape with 0 control points
	- some refactoring and the Navigator view is updated live again

14.06.2004
	- more Bug hunting
	- more Shape tool changes are tracked via undo stack

13.06.2004
	- Bug hunting
	- implemented "outline" mode for Shape tool, outline width is settable.
		to add an outline to an existing shape, simply copy it in the History
		list, double click it to edit, then switch to outline mode

12.06.2004
	- finished updates on Text tool
	- got font menu with submenus working finally
	- updated Development Release on BeBits
	- redesigned Translate tool to be confirmable and more comfortable
		it also features now a temporary undo stack

11.06.2004
	- fixed some remaining problems, started to implement selection of points
		that will be used to perform affine transformations.
	- started to update Text tool to make Text objects editable at any time

10.06.2004
	- fixed remaining bugs. Looks good. Now I need to think of how to handle
		more than one path per "object". Those are needed for holes and stuff.

09.06.2004
	- implemented the missing pieces for temporary history
	- implemented inserting a control point while maintaining the paths
		shape.
	- lots of debugging, but sometimes strange things happen, like hitting
		Escape doesn't redraw everything correctly. Some things can be done
		during editing a shape that should not be permitted to happen.

08.06.2004
	- implemented temporary history for Path tool, but it's not working
		100% smoothly

04-07.06.2004
	- added sophisticated editing, everything is supported now except
		selecting a group of control points and performing affine translations.
		The COMMAND and ALT keys are used to get alternative editing modes.
		COMMAND handles breaking the connection between curve control points
		and ALT can be used to delete any points.

03.06.2004
	- added curves

02.06.2004
	- the vector shape tool is comming along nicely, basic path editing is
		now possible. Curves are missing yet, but should be easy to add.

29.05.2004
	- AGG is faster at rendering transformed gradients than my stupid brush
		rendering at simple circles (if hardness = 0%). Replacing the brush
		rendering with AGG gradients requires writing a different
		pixel format (special blending for brush tips) though.

28.05.2004
	-  I took the effort and ported the platform specific code from AGG to
		compile and run the demos on BeOS. AGG is very flexible and offers
		very many features I was looking for in WonderBrush. As a matter of
		fact, I could replace large parts of what I have already written with
		AGG, main adventage being speed and flexibility improvements.

27.05.2004
	- found out about AGG (Anti Grain Geometry). renderer has the same quality
		as libart, but is faster. The API is C++, consitent though not as
		smooth as Zodius, heavy use of templates. It compiles without changes
		to the code on BeOS.

23.-26.05.2004
	- Zodius has a very nice API, much like BeOS, but libart is faster,
		better suited and doesn't use subsampling.

22.05.2004
	- started work on vector shape tool, initially based on Zodius

19.05.2004
	- looked arround for bugs and found some minor inconsistencies when no settings file is present. Fixed some help strings.

01.05.2004
	- WonderBrush couldn't save a file on a volume other than the /boot volume
		(initial "Save As" worked, but no subsequent "Save" operations) - fixed.
	- fixed some GUI problems when WonderBrush was started with a document,

16.04.2004
	- a history listview item can now be "focused". the Text tool uses it
		to indicate that it is still modifying the item, so the listview
		is kind of locked, no drag'n'drop, no deleting items

31.03.2004
	- copied Becassos "External Editor" feature
		eXposer uses this feature of Becasso, so does, I think,
		Gobe Productive.
	- fixed a crashing BUG that could be "fixed" by deleting the main settings

09.03.2004
	- Text tool is in a "working" state, it has some nice details,
		but is missing many many important features

28.02.2004
	- started to work on Text tool.
		- created FreeType2 based font scanner

23.02.2004
	- added hidden easter egg feature... :-) only shows if canvas is 16x16

20.02.2004
	- fixed calculation of rebuild area for tools that need to extend it.
		this should fix the clone and blur tools display bugs. unfortunately,
		it now resembles the brute force method, which should be revisited
		later...

19.02.2004
	- fixed problem with calculating clipping area during layer rebuild

29.12.2003
	- fixed bug in bitmap modifying routines that caused tools not to work
		when a Translator Bitmap had been loaded.

06.12.2003
	- reworked Crop tool behaviour. Should be easier to use.

05.12.2003
	- added little icon button to top right corner of the main window so
		that it is a little more obvious how to get back from full screen
		mode

22.11.2003
	- experimented with other ways to draw the brush shape.

13.11.2003
	- added more options to the color pick state: "Use All Layers" and
		"Tip Size" 
	- improved the Blur tool, it is based on Gaussian blur now and can have
		an arbitary radius.


...13.11.2003
	- many bug fixes
	- redesigned modifier (object) classes, but reverted changes later
	- implemented aspect restriction for Crop tool (holding down <Shift>)
	- second version of the GUI has little status bar with information about
		the tools, however, this might be a waste of screen-space, since
		eventually, the user will know those options and the space is wasted...
	- lots of other stuff I can't remember
	- usage of the stroke cache is much better, since parts for which there
		is no cache are still drawn
	- stroke cache is saved with the file!

24.10.2003
	- more work on PSD import/export, first tests, but doesn't work

23.10.2003
	- work on PSD import/export

21.10.2003
	- nicer icon for Fill tool, speed improvements (3x but it's still dog slow)

19.10.2003
	- finishing up and integrating Fill tool (cloning, loading/saving)

18.10.2003
	- improvements and debugging for Fill tool

17.10.2003
	- implemented Fill tool

16.10.2003
	- added Paste menu item to Edit menu (watches system clipboard for
		bitmap contents)
	- added additional checks and safety to save panel -> canvas association
	- fixed bugs, where menu items in canvas menu and window title would
		not update when renaming a canvas
	- fixed a crashing bug when moving Pen and Brush tool
	- fixed bugs with wrong placement of RLE cache and some subtile bugs of
		the actual implementation -> what do we do with the off-canvas
		regions, that might be moved into view?!? The solution looks like
		figuring out the parts that need to be drawn the normal way and
		just drawing them...

15.10.2003
	- found better way to traverse segments of lines (stroke based tools)
	- fixed bug in Bitmap object (alpha was handled wrongly)

14.10.2003
	- implemented a "solid" brush mode. it absolutely ignores any
		intermediate alpha values (no antialiasing or soft brush edges)
		useful for drawing icons and such stuff
	- made nicer icon for Move tool
	- Move tool displays "stop" cursor if no objects are selected
	- investigated drawing bug in Pen tool that seems to be caused by
		traversing the segments of the stroke path wrongly

13.10.2003
	- more debugging of RLE buffer
	- made nicer icon for Crop tool

12.10.2003
	- finished RLE buffer implementation. the speed improvement is quite
		drastic, especially with large brushes (120 times for a 200 pixel
		diameter soft brush)

09.10.2003
	- got rid of global setting for subpixel precision, it's now a per
		tool setting (stroke tool(s), Crop and Move tool)
	- improved pixel grid drawing a bit, but it still flickers quite
		annoyingly
	- more alerts in case of errors
	- implemented a special RLE buffer, that can be decompressed into any
		part of a larger (or smaller) bitmap (with optional clipping). this
		can be used to cache the alpha bitmap of strokes and speed up
		redrawing

08.10.2003
	- added alerts when loading a file failed

07.10.2003
	- fixed crashing bug in layer composing, that was only triggerd under
		certain circumstances
	- added ability to dump canvas as BeOS cursor data in C text format
		(gosh, what a huge time saver!)
	- added all the cursors needed for Crop and Move tool (hey,
		selfcontained environment!)
	- changed Crop tool to switch cursor depending on mouse position
	- added option to show a pixel grid (zoom >= 800%)

06.10.2003
	- more of debugging Crop tool

05.10.2003
	- debugging Crop tool

03.10.2003
	- made GUI for Crop tool

02.10.2003
	- removed ScrollState and put that functionality back into CanvasView
	- tested and debugged Crop tool, better tracking behaviour
	- fixed invalidation bug when canvas was zoomed in (rightmost and
		bottom pixels were not updated)
	- fixed Alpha and Inverse Alpha layer blending modes to respect their
		global alpha value

01.10.2003
	- fixed bugs that got introduced by states (colorpicker state). Added
		new convinience that WonderBrush remembers the last "color" tool
		to which it switches back when a swatch is clicked (was always
		Brush before).
	- implemented Crop tool, needs more fine tuning though...

30.09.2003
	- Move tool offsets can now be given numerically (GUI is connected).
		I'm not sure if the way it works is optimal (you cannot move with
		the mouse and fine tune the offset numerically, instead this
		triggers a new move action).
	- removed Subpixel checkbox from Brush Tool GUI, and added a menu
		item in the settings menu, this better reflects the global nature
		of this flag.
	- changes to Move tool action to ensure no CPU cycles are wasted

28.09.2003
	- GUI for Move tool.

26.09.2003
	- took a look at the Gaussian Blur filter from ArtPaint. ported it
		over and played arround with it, but unfortunately, the calculations
		are not quite correct and mix transparent colors wrongly. Turned
		it off again...

18.09.2003
	- implemented drawing functions for B_GRAY8 color space in preparation
	for selections (tools operating in "mask mode")

15.09.2003
	- fixed unexpected behaviour (= bug) when pressing/releasing the shift
		key during drawing a stroke. Now it switches back to drawing a
		straight line from the first point of the stroke.
	- when subpixel precision is switched off, the tool cursor can now
		still be placed freely "inbetween" canvas pixels, which is easier
		to work with: When trying to draw a straight line, it is easier to
		see when the cursor is almost out of the pixel.
	- remembers the weighting between layer and history groups

14.09.2003
	- found the cause of imprecision in conversion between canvas and view
		coordinates

13.09.2003
	- wrote BetterMSplitter class overriding Draw(), placed one of those
		between the layer and history list view -> need to remember the
		weighting in the settings! MSplitter seems to use the old cursor
		setting API, since the arrows keep sticking around most of the times!

10.09.2003
	- finished MoveTool (debugging), subpixel precision rocks, needs GUI now,
		cursor and nicer icon, BitmapModifiers don't invalidate correct
		region of canvas

09.09.2003
	- coded MoveTool (TranslateState) and made icon for it
	- new distinction between MODE_* and TOOL_* IDs

08.09.2003
	- finished moving canvas view functionality into separate canvas view states classes, even managed to avoid some subtile bugs of the previous implementation

05.09.2003
	- more work on CanvasView states: refined the API, StrokeState compiles
	- realised that Language addons need recompiling when new strings are
		 added. changed LanguageManager accordingly, but ultimately, the
		 string lookup by index must go, and be replaced by hash or map
		 lookup with string mapping.

04.09.2003
	- more robust language switching (removes language from menu if addon
		building failed), remembering language in settings is more robust
		too and will actually work if the contents of the Language folder
		change

30.08.2003
	- reacts on B_PASTE to insert a bitmap object if the system clipboard
		 contains a bitmap archive (tested with ArtPaint)
	- started to extract code from canvas view into seperate states
	- uses persistent app clipboard to replace list of cloned modifiers in history list
