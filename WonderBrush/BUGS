* Edit Gradient tool does not update transformation box when transformation done on the gradient's parent object is undone.

* sometimes, WonderBrush keeps insisting the document has not been saved on exit, pressing "Save" will bring up the same alert again

* when rebuilding the Canvas becomes more heavy, the transformation box will not follow the mouse strictly enough, this can be quite annoying, but will go away
after the canvas rebuilding process has been rewritten

* R5 app_server crashes when editing a gradient on an object with
	zero scale (degenerate matrix?) -> but you cannot give objects a zero scale
	from the interface

----------------------
minor bugs/annoyances:

* Transform tool applies subpixel setting to rotation and scale too, even though this doesn't make much sense

* the SetTo() and _Init() process of CanvasView() is probably doing to much/early invalidating, since flashing can be observed (canvas bitmap not yet composed, but white)

* when the Text tools size setting is keyboard controlled, there will be unwanted undo steps added when size already is the minimum or maximum value
