		<h3>Wonderbrush - Creating a button</h3>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Our goal: </b><img src="images/final_button.gif"><br>
		<br>
		This tutorial demonstrates the use of several layers which form a kind of <i>filter chain</i>
		to create the picture of a button. <i>Filter chain</i> means that the graphics data keeps
		getting changed from one layer to the next until the finished button is generated. This enables 
		non-destructive editing that makes it possible to alter every aspect of a picture later on. The
		colour of the whole button can be changed simply by changing the colour of the bucket fill object
		on the lowest layer; the metallic effect and the bevelled edges are automatically re-rendered.
		Since all involved objects are vector-based, the button can always be resized without any pesky
		artifacts from scaling pixels.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Creating the basic look</b><br>
		<b>Goal:</b> <img src="images/step01.png"><br>
		<br>
		Start by creating a new canvas (<b>Canvas</b> menu) with the right size for the button.<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/new_document.png">&nbsp;<img src="images/document_size.png"></center><br>
		<br>		 
		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					Alternatively the crop tool <img src="images/crop_icon.png"> can be used
					on the standard canvas to become the right size.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<br>
		<br>
		Use the fill tool <img src="images/fill_icon.png"> with a grey colour on the empty standard
		layer. <br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/color_and_fill.png"></center><br>
		<br>

		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					The colour of existing objects (and also fill objects) can always
					be changed by selecting them in the object list and assigning a
					new colour via drag&drop.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<br>
		<br>
		After that create a <i>noise filter</i>.</i><br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/noise_filter.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		The "Strength" property of the filter can be increased to later make the metallic effect more
		pronounced. If the "Luminence only" property of the noise filter is activated, the noise will
		be limited to the luminence only and the colour of a pixel will remain untouched.<br>
		<br>

		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					Currently the parameters of a filter can only be specified in the
					<i>Property list</i> after its creation. Every new filter object
					will automatically use the settings that were specified for the last
					filter of that kind.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br>
		<br>
		To achieve that metallic, "brushed" effect, a <i>Motion Blur</i> filter was added.<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/motion_blur_filter.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		This object has only two Properties: The <i>Blur Radius</i>, specifying the extent of the
		fuzziness, and the <i>Angle</i>, i.e. the direction. For the button you should use an angle
		of 90 degrees, giving the blur a horizontal direction. A bigger radius of about 25 to 40 pixels
		should do it for our button.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/noise_added.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		This first layer with the three objects serves as a colour basis for the following links in
		the initially mentioned "filter chain".<br>
		
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Creating the shape of the button</b><br>
		<b>Goal:</b> <img src="images/step02.png"><br>
		<br>
		Add another layer with the <b>Layer</b> menu.<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/new_layer.png"></center><br>
		<br>

		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					New layers are created directly <i>above</i> the currently selected layer.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<br>
		<br>
		The new layer is supposed to cut the rounded shape of the button out of the coloured plane
		of the lower layer. This function is also known as "masking".<br>
		<br>

		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					Every layer in Wonderbrush has a <i>Mode setting</i> (see the <b>Mode</b>
					menu), that defines how this layer influences the layers below it. The "Normal"
					mode simply passes the colour of each pixel according to its opacity. The
					"opacity" of a pixel is also called "alpha". It's just another channel
					besides the three colour channels red, green and blue that saves the opacity
					of every single pixel.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br>
		<br>
		To have this layer work as a mask for the layer below, its mode is set to <i>Alpha</i>.<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/mode_alpha.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		The colour of the layer is completely ignored, while its alpha channel is used to replace
		the alpha channel of the layer below.
		Since there aren't yet any objects on the masking layer, the coloured plane disappears completely.
		<br>
		It will only re-appear at places where objects on the masking layer increase the opacity.
		A <i>straight brush stroke</i>, for example, is suited for the shape of our button. So, change
		to the brush tool <img src="images/brush_icon.png">. <br>
		Choose a brush size ("Radius" control) that's almost the height of the canvas.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/brush_settings.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		You'll see how big the brush will be by the size of the mouse pointer while moving over the
		canvas. The brush should have a <i>hard edge</i>, which means the "Hardness" control should
		be at 100%. The option <i>Solid has to be turned off</i>, as it would deactivate the
		generation of interim values for the opacity of the brush stroke (antialiasing). Set
		<i>Spacing</i> to the minimum. The <i>Subpixel option isn't advantageous at the moment</i> either.
		In a zoomed view it causes a sampling of the mouse position, sort of, "between" the pixels. Anyway,
		you're better served with this option turned off, because the brush will be positioned on
		full pixels only. You'll soon see why.<br>
		<br>
		To create a straight brush stroke, you first click on the left side of the canvas, then,
		while keeping the <i><Shift> key</i> pressed, you click on the right side.<br> 
		<br>

		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					While the <i>&lt;Shift&gt; key</i> is pressed and the mouse button isn't released,
					the end of the brush stroke can still be moved, until a perfectly horizontal
					stroke is achieved. If you don't get it right on the first try, just use the
					<i>Undo function</i> <img src="images/undo_icon.png">.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br>
		<br>
		With the first click, which determined the starting point, already a brush object was created,
		so that the layer now contains two brush objects. The first object can be selected and then
		deleted by clicking on the <i>Trash icon</i> <img src="images/delete_icon.png"> for objects.<br>
		<br>
		The button now already has its shape.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Creating the 3D edges</b><br>
		<b>Goal:</b> <img src="images/step03.png"><br>
		<br>
		Simply copy the whole layer.<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/duplicate_layer.png"></center><br>
		<br>

		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					This can be achieved either by the <b>Layer</b> menu or by drag&drop
					of the layer while pressing the <i>&lt;Shift&gt;</i> key.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br>
		<br>
		The copy of the layer should be <i>in front, i.e. above</i> the other two layers.
		Another "mode" can influence the luminance of the graphics data under a layer.
		So, change the <i>mode of the copied layer to "Luminance"</i>. <br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/mode_luminace.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		Now the colour of the brush objects has an effect (on the masking layer it didn't matter).
		Select the brush object <img src="images/brush_icon.png">, mix a white colour,<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/color_white.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		and <i>drag&drop the colour onto the brush object.</i><br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/three_layers.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		Currently, the brush lightens up the whole button. To illuminate only the upper and left side,
		the brush object has to be partially erased. For that, we copy it in the <b>Object</b> menu,<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/copy_object.png">&nbsp;<img src="images/paste_object.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		or by drag&drop while pressing the <i>&lt;Shift&gt;</i> key. The copy should be <i>under</i> the brush
		object. The <i>"Mode" is set to "Erase"</i> in the Property list of that object.<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/mode_erase.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		<i>The brush object becomes an eraser object.</i> To get a softer edge, the
		property "Hardness" of 100% can be decreased.<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/hardness.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		The object has to be moved, so you change to the <i>Transform tool</i> <img src="images/transform_icon.png">.<br>
		<br>

		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					<i>This tool creates a box enclosing all objects that are
					selected in the objects list.</i> As soon as the box is moved,
					rotated or skewed, this transformation effects these objects;
					it can be edited until the tool is finally applied by clicking
					the green checkmark <img src="images/apply_icon.png">.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<br>
		<br>
		Move and skew the eraser object until it crops the desired part of the white brush object
		or enter the transformation with the keyboard like this:<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/transform_settings_1.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		Now, only the dark border is missing. For that, the whole layer is copied once again.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/duplicate_layer.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		Select the <i>brush object of the copy</i>, mix a colour black and drag&drop it onto the
		object.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/color_black.png">&nbsp;<img src="images/brush_and_eraser.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		To have the brush object effect the lower right edge, the transform tool is used to move the
		eraser object to the <i>opposite direction</i>.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/transform_settings_2.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		Now the bevelled edges are finished.<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Creating a black border</b><br>
		<b>Goal:</b> <img src="images/step04.png"><br>
		<br>
		To draw a black border around the button, the top layer is <i>once more copied.</i>. <br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/duplicate_layer.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		This layer should be a standard colour layer, so the <i>"Mode" is changed back to "Normal"</i>.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/mode_normal.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		An eraser object is needed on this layer as well, but the existing one is already transformed.
		<i>Remove that eraser object.</i><br> 
		<br>
		<center>
			<img src="images/eraser.png">&nbsp; 
			<img src="images/delete_icon.png">&nbsp;
			<img src="images/brush.png">
		</center>
		<br>
		<br>
		Make a copy of the remaining black brush object (make sure it's the last entry in the list),<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/copy_object.png">&nbsp;<img src="images/paste_object.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		and the property <i>"Mode" of the copy again to "Erase".</i><br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/brush_to_eraser.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		Select the <i>black brush object</i> once more,<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/enlarged_brush_1.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		and <i>enlarge it.</i> It's most convenient by increasing the property <i>Radius</i> slightly.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/enlarged_brush_2.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		Since the eraser object currently lies exactly on top of the area cleared by the masking
		layer, a fine gap opens in the opacity of the inner button. It's recommended to <i>shrink the
		object</i> a little bit. With the Transform tool, you'll quickly find the perfect size. It's even
		faster by simply decreasing the property "Radius" with the keyboard.<br>
		<br> 
		<center><img src="images/smaller_eraser.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<b>Creating a label</b><br>
		<b>Goal:</b> <img src="images/step05.png"><br>
		<br>
		The label of the button can be created with the text tool <img src="images/text_icon.png"> on the
		<i>same layer</i>.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/font_settings.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		<center><img src="images/text_object_1.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		To make the text appear to be slightly sunk into the button's surface, copy the text object
		<i>twice</i>. <br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/copy_object.png">&nbsp;<img src="images/paste_object.png"></center><br>
		<br>
		The copies should be <i>behind</i> the original (i.e. in the list above) and their colour set to
		black and white, respectively.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/color_white.png">&nbsp;<img src="images/three_text_objects.png"></center><br>
		<br> 
		With the Transform tool, the <i>black copy</i> is moved to the <i>upper left</i>. This can be done
		quite smoothly by activating the "Subpixel" option of the Transform tool and you've sufficiently 
		zoomed into the canvas.<br>
		The <i>white copy</i> is moved to the <i>lower right</i> accordingly. Again, entering the 
		transformation with the keyboard is a suitable alternative.<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/transform_settings_3.png"></center><br>
		<br>  
		The transparency of both text objects can be decreased with the property <i>Opacity</i>.<br>
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/opacity.png"></center><br>
		<br>

		<table width="100%" cellpadding=0 cellspacing=10 bgcolor="#FFF3AF" >
			<tr>
				<td><img src="images/info_icon.png"></td>
				<td><font size="2">
					You can <i>double click a text object</i> to edit it once more
					in the text tool. The opacity can be changed with the control there.
				</font></td>
			</tr>
		</table>

		<br>
		<br>
		The result is a button like this:<br> 
		<br>
		<center><img src="images/step06.png"></center><br>
