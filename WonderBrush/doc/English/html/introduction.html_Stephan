				WonderBrush is an editor for bitmap graphics. These are
				called <b>Canvas</b> and are the WonderBrush documents.
				The main window holds any number of such documents.
				Every Canvas can contain several <b>Layers</b>. From the
				bottom to the top, every Layer overlays the previous
				according to its Mode setting until the final image is
				formed. Every Layer, which is empty and thus completely
				transparent by default, can contain any number of
				graphical <b>Objects</b>, which again overlay each other
				on the Layer.
				These Objects are created by the WonderBrush <b>Tools</b>.
				There are several types of Objects, like Brush strokes, 
				Text objects or Filters. Each Object is associated with
				a number of <b>Properties</b>, which define its
				appearance. The power of WonderBrush lies in the fact
				that the order of Objects on the Layer or any of their 
				Properties can be changed at any time.
				To simplify access to the Objects and their Properties, 
				WonderBrush displays three lists: The Layer, Object and
				Property list. The active Layer is set in the Layer list,
				the Object list will only display Objects contained on
				that Layer. If only one Object is selected, that Object's
				Properties are displayed in the Property list. The Object
				and Property list each own their private clipboard,
				so that Objects or Properties may be quickly copied and
				pasted. Properties with the same name are compatible
				between different types of Objects.
