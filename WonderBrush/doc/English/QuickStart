Welcome

Thank you very much for chosing WonderBrush! Even if this is a young product, it is already a powerful creative tool, and will evolve in exciting ways throughout the next years.


Installation

Note: If the CD does not automatically show up on your desktop after inserting, you can right-click the desktop and display it from the "Mount" menu.

Open the CD and the installation package "WonderBrush-2.0.0-x86.pkg" by double clicking. You can chose destination folder for the installation, or leave the default "/boot/apps".

Note: After installation, the WonderBrush folder can be moved anywhere else on your ZETA partition. Be sure to have only one WonderBrush installation on your system.

After all files have been copied, the installer will ask for permission to install a shortcut to WonderBrush in the ZETA menu. You should agree to this, but you can also create the shortcut manually at a later time.


Launching WonderBrush

At first launch, WonderBrush will ask for your Serial Number. The Serial Number is on a piece of paper in the cover of the CD. After having entered the correct Serial Number, you're ready to start using WonderBrush.


First Steps

By default, WonderBrush will display descriptions above most controls and areas of the interface, that will help you in getting to know the software. We additionall recommend to read at least the chapter "Introduction" in the documentation. You will be introduced to the most important concepts of WonderBrush. Depending on which software you have worked with already, you will have certain expectations of the application. WonderBrush has things in common, but also differences in comparison with other grafics software. The chapter "Introduction" will help you understand the fundamental concepts of WonderBrush. 

We wish you great fun and success with our software!
